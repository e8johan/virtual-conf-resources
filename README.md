# Virtual Conference Resources

This repository contains resources for organizers of virtual conferences.

The background to this repository is that the [foss-north 2020](https://foss-north.se/2020/) conference had to go virtual due to the COVID-19 situation during the spring of 2020. The repository is split into a general description of the foss-north setup, and links to various tools that can be used.

Pull requests are welcome!
